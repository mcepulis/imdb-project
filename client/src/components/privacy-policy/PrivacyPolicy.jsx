              pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents

              Services may include third-party advertising and links to other

              information about you when you interact with their content,

            <strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong> We provide
            ad-serving companies, ad networks and advertising companies with
            information that allows them to serve you with more useful and
            relevant ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your
            name or other information that directly identifies you when we do
            this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or
            other device identifier. For example, we may share a cookie or
            advertising identifier together with a request to deliver an
            advertisement with an ad network to enable you to receive more
            relevant ads. As an additional example, if you have already
            downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising
            identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served
            an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this
            information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You
            can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising
            (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the Your
            Ads Privacy Choices page.
